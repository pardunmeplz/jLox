# Crafting Interpreters

This is my jLox implementation project following the very fun book Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystorm.
It is a tree walk interpreter (nooooooob), it's written in Java, 'j'Lox, and its just me learning theory and following
the book. 

check out the book and its original implementations by the author [here](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters)
